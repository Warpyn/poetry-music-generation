Poem,Valence,Arousal
"
    Blood red,
Shing evily,
Silently laughing at my pain.
He enjoys it,
No...He loves it, The pain he makes others feel.
He does not speak,
But I know when I feel his eyes piercing mine, 
He is laughing inside.
I shiver in fear,
When his eyes, 
Come near.
It is true im scared,
Of his eyes and him, 
His eyes tell the things he does not.
His eyes, 
Blood red, 
Tourment me.
