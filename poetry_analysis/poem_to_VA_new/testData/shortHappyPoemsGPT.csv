"In the garden of light, where joy blooms bright,
Each petal a tale of delight.
Sun kisses the leaves, as the heart believes,
In a world so vivid and right.",joy
"Laughter rings through the air, light as a feather,
A melody shared, binding us together.
Each chuckle a spark, in daylight or dark,
Making every moment better.",joy
"Dance in the rain, with a heart untamed,
Let each drop wash away your strain.
Twirl with glee, wild and free,
In this joyous, life-filled refrain.",joy
"Happiness, a bird, sings in my soul,
Flapping wings of gold, making me whole.
In its flight, day and night,
Filling the void, playing its role.",joy
"Stars twinkle above, in a dance of love,
Reflecting the joy from below.
In the night's embrace, with celestial grace,
They make our inner light glow.",joy
