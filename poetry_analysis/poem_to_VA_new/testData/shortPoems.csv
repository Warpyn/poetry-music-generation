"A Tree
A tree beside the sandy river-beach 
    Holds up its topmost boughs 
Like fingers towards the skies they cannot reach, 
    Earth-bound, heaven amorous. 

This is the soul of man. Body and brain 
Hungry for earth our heavenly flight detain.

"Revelation


Someone leaping from the rocks
Past me ran with windblown
locks Like a startled bright surmise
Visible to mortal eyes, ?€?
Just a cheek of frightened rose
That with sudden beauty glows,
Just a footstep like the wind
And a hurried glance behind,
And then nothing, ?€? as a thought
Escapes the mind ere it is caught.
Someone of the heavenly rout
From behind the veil ran out.",sad
"Life And Death

Life, death, - death, life; the words have led for ages
Our thought and consciousness and firmly seemed
Two opposites; but now long-hidden pages
Are opened, liberating truths undreamed.
Life only is, or death is life disguised, -
Life a short death until by Life we are surprised.",peace
"God

Thou who pervadest all the worlds below,
Yet sitst above,
Master of all who work and rule and know,
Servant of Love!

Thou who disdainest not the worm to be 
Nor even the clod,
Therefore we know by that humility
That thou art God.",surprise
"Soul In The Ignorance


Soul in the Ignorance, wake from its stupor.
Flake of the world-fire, spark of Divinity,
Lift up thy mind and thy heart into glory.
Sun in the darkness, recover thy lustre.

Wheeling no more with inconscient Nature,
Feel thyself God-born, know thyself deathless.
Timeless return to thy immortal existence.",peace
"Winter

It smelt of new rains and of tender
Shoots of plants- and its warmth was the warmth
Of earth groping for roots?€? even my
Soul, I thought, must send its roots somewhere
And, I loved his body without shame,
On winter evenings as cold winds
Chuckled against the white window-panes.",love
"A Losing Battle

How can my love hold him when the other
Flaunts a gaudy lust and is lioness
To his beast? Men are worthless, to trap them

Love, which in a woman must mean tears
And a silence in the blood.

Annette,
At the dresser.
Pale fingers over mirror-fields
Reaping
That wheat brown hair.

While calenders

"The Maggots

At sunset, on the river ban, Krishna 
Loved her for the last time and left...

That night in her husband's arms, Radha felt 
So dead that he asked, What is wrong, 
Do you mind my kisses, love? And she said, 
No, not at all, but thought, What is 
It to the corpse if the maggots nip? 

",sad
"The Rain

We left that old ungainly house
When my dog died there, after
The burial, after the rose
Flowered twice, pulling it by its
Roots and carting it with our books,
Clothes and chairs in a hurry.
We live in a new house now,
And, the roofs do not leak, but, when
It rains here, I see the rain drench
That empty house, I hear it fall
Where my puppy now lies,
Alone..

"Could I ever forget him

by Lalan

English version by Deben Bhattacharya
Original Language Bengali

Could I ever forget him
since I delivered my heart
at his feet?
His beauty enchants my eyes
round the compass
wherever I steer myself.

Though all call him black,
He is not black.
He is the glow of the moon--
the black moon,
and there is no other moon to equal him....

"He talks to me

by Lalan

English version by Deben Bhattacharya
Original Language Bengali

He talks to me
But he would not let me see him.
He moves
Close to my hands
But away from my reach.
I explore
The sky and the earth
Searching him,
Circling round my error
Of not knowing me:
Who am I
And who is he?",sad
"Meeting the prophetess

Leave your books behind.

Since memory,
Like knowledge, is a traitor,
Erase every hoarding of your horrible past.

At last, when you enter her world
Of fraying edges and falling angels
Don't barter words where touch will do and be the truth.
For once allow her silence to sear, strip your life-layers
Because she who knows the truth will not know the tale.

Morning Song

Wet pink
And dusty grey
The sky begins to blush.
Some sleepy careless charm welcomes
Daybreak.

Even Song

And pink gold hues
The smug sky at twilight
A final flush of fulfilment
Night falls.

This note comes as a consolation:

                 With your left hand.
                 Besides, fascist Dronacharyas warrant
                 Left-handed treatment.

"Aggression

Ours is a silence
that waits. Endlessly waits.

And then, unable to bear it
any further, it breaks into wails.

But not all suppressed reactions
end in our bemoaning the tragedy.

Sometimes,
the outward signals
of inward struggles takes colossal forms
And the revolution happens because our dreams explode.

Most of the time:

Aggression is the best kind of trouble-shooting.

O Fool, try to carry thyself upon thy own shoulders!

"Lover's Gifts IV: She Is Near to My Heart 

She is near to my heart as the meadow-flower to the earth; she is

Then finish the last song and let us

"The Gardener XXII: When She Passed by Me 

When she passed by me with quick
steps, the end of her skirt touched

From the unknown island of a 
heart came a sudden warm breath of

A flutter of a flitting touch brushed
me and vanished in a moment, like a 
torn flower petal blown in the breeze.
It fell upon my heart like a sigh of
her body and whisper of her heart.

If the day is done,

The sun of the first day

In the hush of evening-

Love adorns itself;

it waits to be accepted.

The butterfly counts not months but moments,

Carven with delicate dreams and wrought

Like a joy on the heart of a sorrow,

A golden storm of glittering sheaves,
Of fair and frail and fluttering leaves,

   To my heart in the voice of the wind:
My heart is weary and sad and alone,
For its dreams like the fluttering leaves have gone,
   And why should I stay behind?

My soul is bent low with the pain 
And the burden of love, like the grace 
Of a flower that is smitten with rain: 
O shelter my soul from thy face! ",love

"The Pain Shows

When I look into your eyes, 
I see the pain you try to hide.
You try to be tough, 
But the pain shows 
The hurting, 
And the suffering that this is causing you
The pain shows
Although you act as if nothing is wrong, 
The pain shows
You try to be brave
But the pain shows
You try to hide the tears
But the pain shows
Who knew looking into your eyes would reveal so much pain

"Does My Daddy Love Me?

Does my daddy love me when he doesn't talk to me?
Does my daddy love me when he doesn?€?t spend time with me?
Does my daddy love me when he doesn't make me feel special?
Does my daddy love me when he doesn?€?t call me see how I'm doing?
Does my daddy love me when he hasn't been to my birthday in 7 years?
Dose my daddy love me? 
Really? If so, how come he doesn't show it?

"I'm A Sad Fairy

She is very beautiful 
one of a kind
she's normal and simple
but she's hard to find
she holds her anger in
but she dreams of fantasy's
she commits many sin's
but seeks a true destiny
she has beautiful long brown hair
she lets it down at night
she's in the starry sky and everywhere
her presents makes light
I see her in the mirror
but in her eyes she holds fear

"Daughter Taken By Mothers Lies

Have you any clue ?
To the pain
You have put
Me through ?
Pain so deep
With in me.
That at night
When I finally
Close my eye's
To sleep
I can hear
My 
SOUL
WEEP !

"Rain

I sit and watch
as the rain falls 
from a sky so dark and gray

Is this life
a crying sky
if so,
not even I can fight

I'm tired of hurting
I'm tired of tears
I'm tired of being alone
for all these years

I want peace
and I want love
I want to break free
to fly above!
