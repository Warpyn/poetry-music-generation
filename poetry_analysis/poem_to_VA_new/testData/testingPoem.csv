"The Rain

We left that old ungainly house
When my dog died there, after
The burial, after the rose
Flowered twice, pulling it by its
Roots and carting it with our books,
Clothes and chairs in a hurry.
We live in a new house now,
And, the roofs do not leak, but, when
It rains here, I see the rain drench
That empty house, I hear it fall
Where my puppy now lies,
Alone..

"Aggression

Ours is a silence
that waits. Endlessly waits.

And then, unable to bear it
any further, it breaks into wails.

But not all suppressed reactions
end in our bemoaning the tragedy.

Sometimes,
the outward signals
of inward struggles takes colossal forms
And the revolution happens because our dreams explode.

Most of the time:

Aggression is the best kind of trouble-shooting.

"Blood red,

Shing evily,

Silently laughing at my pain.

He enjoys it,

No...He loves it, The pain he makes others feel.

He does not speak,

But I know when I feel his eyes piercing mine, 

He is laughing inside.

I shiver in fear,

When his eyes, 

Come near.

It is true im scared,

Of his eyes and him, 

His eyes tell the things he does not.

His eyes, 

Blood red, 

Tourment me.",fear
"YOUR LAUGHTER  

YOUR LAUGHTER
Your laughter, 
a blossoming bud, 
eyes like peacock, 
vivacious, sweet your laughter, 
what are the feelings, 
on your faces, 
your laughter, 
like a melodious rain, 
creates sensations in the heart, 
your laughter
benumbs the eyes
i pray, 
you carry on laughing

"Peace, my heart, let the time for
the parting be sweet.
Let it not be a death but completeness.
Let love melt into memory and pain
into songs.
Let the flight through the sky end
in the folding of the wings over the
nest.
Let the last touch of your hands be
gentle like the flower of the night.
Stand still, O Beautiful End, for a
moment, and say your last words in
silence.
I bow to you and hold up my lamp 
to light you on your way.",joy
"At last I find a meaning of soul's birth
Into this universe terrible and sweet,
I who have felt the hungry heart of earth
Aspiring beyond heaven to Krishna's feet.
I have seen the beauty of immortal eyes,
And heard the passion of the Lover's flute,
And known a deathless ecstasy's surprise
And sorrow in my heart for ever mute.
Nearer apd nearer now the music draws,
Life shudders with a strange felicity;
All Nature is a wide enamoured pause
Hoping her lord to touch, to clasp, to be.
For this one moment lived the ages past;
The world now throbs fulfilled in me at last",joy
"The Dreamboat

Who was it that came to me in a boat made of dream-fire,
With his flame brow and his sun-gold body?
Melted was the silence into a sweet secret murmur,
""Do you come now? Is the heart's fire ready?""

Hidden in the recesses of the heart something shuddered,
It recalled all that the life's joy cherished,
Imaged the felicity it must leave lost forever,
And the boat passed and the gold god vanished.

Now within the hollowness of the world's breast inhabits - 
For the love died and the old joy ended - 
Void of a felicity that has fled, gone for ever,
And the gold god and the dream boat come not.",sad
"To Weep Because

To weep because a glorious sun has set
Which the next morn shall gild the east again;
To mourn that mighty strengths must yield to fate
Which by that force a double strength attain;
To shrink from pain without whose friendly strife
Joy could not be, to make a terror of death
Who smiling beckons us to farther life,
And is a bridge for the persistent breath;
Despair and anguish and the tragic grief 
Of dry set eyes, or such disastrous tears
As rend the heart, though meant for its relief, 
And all man's ghastly company of fears
Are born of folly that believes the span
Of life the limit of immortal man.",sad
"The violin of all human minds is playing with one harmony today, and so is the scent of every heart.
With Your sweet appearance, You have descended on the Earth, giving the same realization.
Do not break this garland of flowers, which is the entire wealth of my love.
Come closer and still closer and closer;
and take away my everything.",love
"I have been a wanderer long
In this world of transient things.
I have known the passing pleasures thereof.
As the rainbow is beautiful
But soon vanishes into nothingness,
So have I known,
From the very foundation of the world,
The passing away of all things
Beautiful, joyous and pleasurable.

As the moon is full and serene,
In the day of harvest
So am I
In the day of my Liberation
Simple as the tender leaf am I
For in me are many winters and many springs.
As the dew drop is of the sea,
So am I born
In the ocean of my Liberation

As the mysterious river
Enters the open seas,
So have I entered
Into the world of Liberation
This is the end I have known.",joy
"Dad
 
Thanks for believing in me.
Thanks for showing me you care.
Thanks for holding my hand
Thanks for being there.
Thanks for being the best
Thanks for making me glad
Thanks for loving me with all your heart.
Thanks for being my dad.

^Now after every 'thanks for' add never.
