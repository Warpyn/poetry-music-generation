Free of memory and of hope,limitless, abstract, almost future,the dead man is not a dead man: he is death.Like the God of the mystics,of Whom anything that could be said must be denied,the dead one, alien everywhere,is but the ruin and absence of the world.We rob him of everything,we leave him not so much as a color or syllable:here, the courtyard which his eyes no longer see,there, the sidewalk where his hope lay in wait.Even what we are thinking,he could be thinking;we have divvied up like thievesthe booty of nights and days.
